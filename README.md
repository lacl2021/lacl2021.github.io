## Logical Aspects of Computational Linguistics 2021

##### Extended deadline: July 11, 2021

LACL 2021 is the tenth international conference on Logical Aspect of Computational Linguistics. The scope of this conference is the use of type theoretic, proof theoretic and model theoretic methods for describing natural language syntax, semantics and pragmatics as well as the implementation of natural language processing software relying on logical formalisation. LACL 2021 will be held online 13-17 december 2021, as part of the Mathematical Linguistics (MALIN) week, and held conjointly with Mathematics of Language, [Logic and Algorithms in Computational Linguistics](https://staff.math.su.se/rloukanova/LACompLing2021-web/), and Natural Language and Computer Science.

### Scope

Computer scientists, linguists, mathematicians and philosophers are invited to present their work on the use of logical methods in computational linguistics and natural language processing, in natural language analysis, generation or acquisition.

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to:

- Logical foundation of syntactic formalisms, in particular categorial grammars and other type theoretic grammars, parsing as deduction, model theoretic syntax;
- Logical frameworks for lexical semantics;
- Logical semantics of sentences, discourse and dialogue;
- Applications of these logical frameworks to natural language processing tasks (automated analysis, generation, acquisition, textual inference);
- Applications of the logical formalisation of language faculty to cognitive sciences.

### Submission

Articles should be written in the LaTeX format of LNCS by Springer (see authors instructions at [http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0)).

LACL accepts two kinds of papers:

- Regular (long) papers between 12 and 16 pages.
- Short papers (work in progress, system descriptions, position papers) between 4 and 8 pages.

Submission is exclusively admitted electronically, in PDF format, through the EasyChair system. The submission site is
